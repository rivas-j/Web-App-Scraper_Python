# <div align="center">Goals</div>

What should be true after this project is implemented? The objective is to demonstrate the project's value. Edit for clarity and remove any language specific to curriculum (i.e. fictional names, narratives). Make the report seem like a case study, not an assignment. Include a high-level overview of the analysis so that recruiters with limited technical knowledge can understand what your project is about without drilling down.  The key is to make everything easy for employers so they can review more of your work.

Sample: Puppy Analysis answers the question, how many puppies were adopted from shelters across the United States during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic. Observes a total number of dogs adopted, breed demographics, and the number of dogs adopted by a state.‚Äù
